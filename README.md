## Introduction
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence project where we attempt to forecast the price of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.
Historical stock data is obtained using the [alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API. The data was prepared for and explored using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and the model was trained using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.
